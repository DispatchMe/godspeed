Godspeed is a statsd client for the Datadog extension of statsd (DogStatsD).

poke at the fact that the statsd protocol's transport mechanism is UDP...

Check out [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/PagerDuty/godspeed) for the docs
as well as some examples. Some usage information will be added to this README soon.
